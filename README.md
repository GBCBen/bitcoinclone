What is this OLD Shiz?
-------------------------
It's a backdated version 0.15 Bitcoin GIT, for use in GIT Url parameter with CrombieCrunch Coinbuilder script.

This solved an error when trying to use the Master Branch Git url for building Bitcoin on a recent yiimp/yaamp install.

This is a quick and dirty solution to a problem you may have... I can't guarantee anything about it... It may help... Other issues may be strange folder permissions in creating other coins, and changing a linux Berkley DB version 4.8.

If you find my crude effort useful consider donating some BTC: 1MRgReLZgxbVBtGpKuUbgPmFR4S7mZUeWD

Thanks, I'll clean things up if I get a chance...

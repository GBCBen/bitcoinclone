Bitcoin Last Version v0.15.0.1
-------------------------
This is a backdated version of Bitcoin to 15.0.1, for use in GIT Url parameter with CrombieCrunch's Coinbuilder script.

This solved an error when trying to use the Master Branch Git url for building Bitcoin using CrombieCrunch's builder script, on a recent yiimp/yaamp install.

This is possibly a quick and dirty solution to a problem you may have. It may help... Other issues I've encountered are with that build script are strange folder permissions in creating other coins folders, and changing a linux Berkley DB version 4.8.

If you find my crude effort useful consider donating some BTC: 1MRgReLZgxbVBtGpKuUbgPmFR4S7mZUeWD

Thanks, I'll clean things up if I get a chance...
